// `STUTextFrameData`, `STUTextFrameParagraph` and `STUTextFrameLine` instances are not

// so will be the `STUTextFrameData`, `STUTextFrameParagraph` and `STUTextFrameLine` instances.
// Hence, while you access these data structs through pointers into memory owned by a text frame,
// you need to make sure that the text frame is kept alive, e.g. by storing a reference to the text
// frame in a local variable that is annotated with the NS_VALID_UNTIL_END_OF_SCOPE attribute.
