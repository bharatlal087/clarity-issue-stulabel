///
/// @c STUTextAttachment instances are meant to be used as values for the
/// @c STUAttachmentAttributeName (@c .stuAttachment) key in @c NSAttributedString instances
/// that are displayed in @c STULabel views or rendered with the help of @c STUTextFrame instances.
///
/// @c STUTextAttachment is a replacement for @c NSTextAttachment that is more suitable for the
/// purposes of this library.
///
/// @c STUTextAttachment is meant to be used as a base class, e.g. for @c STUImageTextAttachment,
/// but you can also use it directly in order to create blank spaces in the running text, so that
/// you can e.g. place subviews over their locations.
///
/// @note
///  Subclasses of @c STUTextAttachment are expected to be immutable and the @c drawInContext method
///  must be thread-safe.
///
/// In attributed strings an attachment should normally only be set as an attribute on a U+FFFC
/// character (@c NSAttachmentCharacter). When it is set on multiple characters, it will be drawn
/// multiple times.
///
/// Core Text does not support attachments directly and requires a @c CTRunDelegate attribute for
/// every attachment in order to compute correct typographic bounds.
///
/// In Objective-C code you can use the `+[NSAttributedString stu_newWithSTUAttachment:]` factory
/// method to conveniently create an attributed string containing a single U+FFFC character with
/// the specified attachment and an appropriate run delegate as attributes. In Swift code this
/// factory method is available as the initializer
/// `NSAttributedString(stu_attachment: myAttachment)`.
///
/// @c CTRunDelegate instances do not support @c NSCoding. Hence, if you need to archive an
/// @c NSAttributedString containing run delegates, you first need to remove the run delegates,
/// e.g. by using the `-[NSAttributedString stu_attributedStringByRemovingCTRunDelegates]`
/// method. To add back missing run delegates for @c STUTextAttachment instances you can use the
/// `-[NSAttributedString stu_attributedStringByAddingCTRunDelegatesForSTUTextAttachments]` method.
///
/// You can make a @c STUTextAttachment value individually accessible in a @c STULabel by setting
/// @c isAccessibilityElement to true and defining appropriate accessibility properties. However,
/// specifying an appropriate @c stringRepresentation when constructing the attachment is often
/// already enough to ensure good accessibility.
///
/// Equality for @c STUTextAttachment instances is defined as pointer equality.
